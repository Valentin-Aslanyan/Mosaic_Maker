Create Classical (like republic era Rome) mosaics out of digital images. Work In Progress; currently uses Python's Matplotlib for visualization, but will eventually be turned into a standalone compiled GUI, probably with qt5.

Beginning with an image

you can split it into pieces by clicking to select vertices and their connections. The algorithm will then split the input image into the pieces; a version with "averaged" colors, which looks more like a typical mosaic is made.

The algorithm can be used to make a real mosaic, most easily out of plastics (example to follow) with other outputs. The pieces are numbered by the algorithm to assemble the physical copy.

PDF files, which can be printed to scale (on A4 paper, for instance) are generated.
